# sapiens_amazon_wordcloud

this is a quick prep-work for the text analysis exercise I published on [my blog](https://kkulma.github.io/2017-03-07-amazon-reviews-wordcloud/): I test which approach to web-scraping works ;) The purpose is to scrape Amazon website from reviews of Yuval Harrari's book "Sapiens" and, after some text cleaning and pre-processing, finally create a wordcloud of top 250 most frequent words.
